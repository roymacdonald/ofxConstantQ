=====================================

Constant Q transform addon for openFrameworks.

[Constant Q transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_Q_transform) info.
Efficient algorithm based on this [paper](http://academics.wellesley.edu/Physics/brown/pubs/effalgV92P2698-P2701.pdf)
C++ implementation made following this [MatLab implementation](http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/logik/Personen/blankertz/constQ/constQ.html).

####WARNING: Super Beta version! 
I had a quite polished version, but lost it on a hardrive failure :$

I'll rewrite it soon and publish it.

Licence
-------
Read `license.md` file.

Compatibility
-------------
Made using a [custom branch](https://github.com/roymacdonald/openFrameworks/tree/feature-sound-objects) of openFrameworks.

I'll update it soon to use the current version of OF and add the missing libs and files.
